**Abstract:**

1. Developed image classification pipeline using CNN with 90% accuracy streamlining educational research.
2. Automated extraction of learner actions and corresponding times stamps from unstructured data.
3. This project was done as part of the ET610 Learning Analytics course project, under the guidance of Prof. Ramkumar Rajendran, IDP in Educational Technology , IIT Bombay.

**Details:**

**Problem Statement:**
In the domain of Educational Technology, research scholars collect student interaction data (video recording/screen recording) while the students's interacts with the learning platform. 
This data needs to be manually analysed in order to identify at what time the learner performed which action. It is not possible to do this task manually if the sample size 
is too large.

**
Solution Provided:**
An Image Classification model was developed which was trained on manually annotated images which were divided into seven
different categories that is Excel, Jupyter success/error, ChatGPT reading/writing/generating and Other. 
The model correctly identifies the learner actions and returns an output in the form of a csv file
containing the Time stamps and the Learner Action (excel, other , Jupyter success/error, ChatGPT reading/writing/generating and other).
